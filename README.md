<h1>Home Inventory ReadMe</h1>

A home is much more than a place to live. It’s where we feel safest and where we cultivate our lives. One of the biggest violations is a stranger forcing their way in and taking your possessions. Not just your possessions, but the things that belong in the museum of your life.

Unfortunately, the makers behind Home Inventory know from first hand experience how devastating it can be to have your privacy violated and irreplaceable items looted. After an event like this happens, the last thing you want to do is deal with insurance.

This is where Home Inventory comes in. We’ve put together an app that makes it easy to keep track of all the items in your home. From a single DVD to the biggest piece of furniture, Home Inventory ensures you’re covered from toe to tip. 

As a user, simply create an account and then start logging your items. Keeping a home inventory on hand is something that can also be of great use when moving, rearranging, or just decluttering your home. 

In the creation of this application, the Home Inventory team used underscore.js to help make our application more robust. 

While we like what our application can do, there’s always room for improvement. For future developers, we would like to see:
<ul>
<li><b>API Integration</b> Bringing in APIs to help determine the value of items would help keep everything up to date with demand and inflation. </li>
<li><b>More Robust Design</b> We would like to see more design flair when it comes to an app that’s more aesthetically pleasing. </li>
<li><b>More Options for Renters</b> This app is geared towards homeowners, we would like to make functionality for renters and even renters who happen to have the same address. For example, multiple people living in one unit.</li>
<li><b>Export a Report</b> We would like to create a function where a user can export a list of the items in their home.</li>
<li><b>Populate Location</b> When a user goes to type in thier location, they will be able to choose thier city and location from a dropdown menu.</li>
<li><b>Choose Categories</b> With more time, we would like to create dropdown menus for a user so they can choose from specific asset category and then be able to view assets by category.</li>
</ul>
